# my python utilities

* in this repository, I am going to share the utils that I have developed for my python programming. 
  * if you are interested, stay tuned, I am going to slowly organize the codes and add proper documentations for functions and classes.
* The utils cover functions and classes for machine learning, and signal processing, and more general purposes.
* The covered applications are:
  * MEG/EEG data processing (building on MNE Python and Scipy.signal)
  * Histopathological images (building on openslide, skimage)

* Please feel fee to use the codes, and also to suggest improvements or corrections.
* Please mention this repository in your codes, where you use functions and classes from this repository.
